# Advanced-PDF-
Its app which has basic features of PDF reader with advanced features like read marker, speed meter etc.
Actually I want to implement a pdf reader kind of app which also have some special and advanced features.
1)Read Marker-
  It is a word heighlighter.
  it run continuesly which highlight sentence in horizontal way.
  It start from left upper corner and as user read it will pass from word to word, in this way it will cover all document sentence by sentence as per reader's speed.
  Hence its name is read marker.
2)Speed meter-
  It use to set speed of read marker.
  which help reader to set speed.
  At a glance how many words should be highlight it can set by a reader. for ex 5 words per step.
  Or it will set time from min 5second to 1 minit maz to read a sentence.
3)Inbuilt Dictionary-
  Its another feature.
  If any reader stuck on a word because he dont know meaning, this app will provide a option to view meaning.
